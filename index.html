      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>
        Mēxihco is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire,
        namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories, with its people
        being known as the Mexica. The terms are plainly linked; it is generally
        believed that the toponym for the valley was the origin of the primary
        ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance, but it may have been the other
        way around. In the colonial era, when Mexico was called New Spain, this
        central region became the Intendency of Mexico, during the
        eighteenth-century reorganization of the empire, the Bourbon Reforms.
        After the colony achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821,
        said territory came to be known as the State of Mexico, with the new
        country being named after its capital: Mexico City, which itself was
        founded in 1524 on the site of the ancient Mexica capital of
        Mexico-Tenochtitlan.

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>
        The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior
        all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called
        cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen,
        making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote
        Sagrado" or Sacred Cenote, is the most famous. In 2015, scientists
        determined that there is a hidden cenote under Kukulkan, which has never
        been seen by archaeologists. According to post-Conquest sources,
        pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote
        as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson
        dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of
        gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of
        human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds
        consistent with human sacrifice.

      <h2>Observance</h2>
      <p>
        Plans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the
        goods to be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families
        usually clean and decorate graves; most visit the cemeteries where their
        loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with ofrendas, which
        often include orange Mexican marigolds called cempasúchil. In modern
        Mexico the marigold is sometimes called Flor de Muerto. These flowers
        are thought to attract souls of the dead to the offerings. It is also
        believed the bright petals with a strong scent can guide the souls from
        cemeteries to their family homes.
